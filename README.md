## [VIEW DEMO](http://cmdv.github.io/cycle-webpack-boilerplate/)

Boilerplate for bdd / tdd / testing with Tape + Testem + Webpack + Cycle.js

Hot reloads app + re-runs test on file updates!

## Installation

```javascript
npm install //install dependencies
```


## Usage

```javascript
npm start //start webpack-dev-server with cycle + hot reload

For tests to run properlly and hot reloading, make sure you have both npm scripts running at the same time!

## Other Boilerplates:
[cycle-browserify-boilerplate](https://github.com/kahlil/cycle-browserify-boilerplate) by [kahlil](https://github.com/kahlil) is very similar to this boilerplate but using Browserify as the build center of it's build process.

## To Do's
1. More tests!

2. Get an isolated component built that can be reused in multiple places in the app

3. Create a localStorage implementation to keep state alive over page refresh

4. Look at expanding with different build tools, specifically Browserify.
